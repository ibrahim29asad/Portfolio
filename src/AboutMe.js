        A Little About Myself üòÅ:
        <br />
        <div className='About-Text'>
          My name is Ibrahim Asad. <br /> <br />

          I am Studying at the University of Calgary as Fifth Year Student, while
          finishing a 16-month Internship. <br /> <br />

          I want to learn about all types of topics and love to challenge myself.
          My love to challenge myself and try again is why I chose to do
          my degree,
          <LinearGradient gradient={['to right', '#0acdf0 ,#ffffff']}>
            Software Engineering with a Minor in Biomedical
            Engineering. <br /> <br />
          </LinearGradient>

          I Love Sneakers and to explore and try new Cuisines and
          Restaurants as well as play Basketball, watch Anime‚Äôs, and
          reading Manga. My Favourite Team is the
          Toronto Raptors <br /> <br />

          My favourite Anime‚Äôs and Mangas are Naruto, Boruto, Dragon
          Ball Super, My Hero Academia, and Hunter x Hunter.

          However, if I‚Äôm not doing these things I love to play
          Mario Kart Online and hopefully I will finish Hogwarts Legacy
          one day üòÖ.<br /> <br />

          Coding has always interested me with the Idea of being able to
          remotely create anything with just a single computer, and try to
          use the inspiration I get from Sneakers to design things. <br /> <br />
